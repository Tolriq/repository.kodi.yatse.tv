# repository.kodi.yatse.tv

This repository contains scripts and plugins to enhance Kodi experience when used from Yatse.

You first need to add the repository to your Kodi.

For that download: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tolriq/repository.yatse.kodi/master/zips/repository.yatse.kodi/repository.yatse.kodi-1.0.1.zip
Then install it from Kodi

Some code and inspiration are taken from: https://github.com/Nemiroff/script.yatse2quasar
The unknown url resolving is made via https://github.com/tvaddonsco/script.module.urlresolver with a modified addon id to avoid clash and be sure that there's no need for other repository that could push unwanted unsafe addons.
